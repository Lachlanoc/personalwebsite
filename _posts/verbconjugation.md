## Introduction
I've always found verb conjugation to be one of the hardest parts of learning Japanese so after being inspired by
[this](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKE2apiBVul/) instagram reel by @japon_go I decided to compile it into a table
that I could print out and hang up.

I ended up with 83 words in total. I did use an LLM to fill in the meanings, formality, and grammar type after realising
how long it would take me to do by hand, however I then checked over everything by myself and with my tutor.

|Form          |Meaning (Refined)                                                                                           |Formality|Grammar Type     |
