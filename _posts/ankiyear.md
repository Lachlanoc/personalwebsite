# Intro title

# Managing dopamine throughout the day
Trying to perfect my focus and retention while doing flashcards lead me down a huge rabbit hole of learning about dopamine, optimal study habits
and anything I could get my hands on to study better. One of the most influential and valuable things I changed in my study schedule was doing
flashcard reviews first thing every morning. By studying first thing in the morning my brain hasn't been exposed to activities that would give it dopamine
such as youtube, games, random research topics or whatever it may be. By rolling out of bed, brushing my teeth, and immediately starting reviewing flashcards
it's all I've been exposed to for the morning and keeps me far more focused than trying to do it during random times throughout the day.

This also lead to trying to min-max how I use my phones to reduce distractions meaning I have an almost dedicated second study phone at this point. 
More on this in my [phone setup](/posts/phone-setup) post.

# SRS, FSRS, and optimising settings

## Anki makes me really sleepy
This one I don't understand too much but doing Anki reviews often makes me sleepy, like really sleepy. I usually give it my best to do anki on public
transport heading to uni but this almost always results in me staring at my phone blankly and falling asleep.

With the exception of times when I'm really pumped to do flashcards or I have an exam the next I do find it quite difficult to really get a large 
amount of reviews done. I definitely feel a bit jealous when I see posts about people who have no issues doing flashcards for 1-2 hours everyday
but I just have to direct my energy elsewhere.

# It's okay to reduce the daily new cards
When I first started using Anki I decided on new words everyday no matter what. This was amazing at first and the feeling of progress was amazing
but when I started to come into more busy times during uni and especially during exams everything piled up. I was averaging 300+ reviews everyday \(Now I average 170\)
and it was taking time away from university study that I needed to be doing. This resulted in my quitting using the app for a bit and coming back to a backlog
of soo many reviews I didn't touch the app for a few months.

After starting again with Anki on a fresh deck and no backlog I eased my way in and was a bit more lenient. I still started with 15 new words a day
as I had lots of vocab I already knew to get through but as I found myself having more difficulty balancing flashcards and actual uni work I backed this down to 10
then 5, and stopped new cards during exams.

Taking a more relaxed approach and being a little more lenient with how many new cards I did a day made a huge difference to my motivation and ability to keep up
each day, now I do 5 new words a day on busier days bumping it up to 10 or 15 when I've got a little more time to study. I'm still fairly strict on finishing
my reviews each day \(apart from during exam block\) but removing the extra load for today and the next day has made a huge difference and I strongly recommend anyone
else doing flashcards everyday be a little more lenient with themselves sometimes.
