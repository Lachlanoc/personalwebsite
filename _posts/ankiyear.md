After two years of using Anki and a streak nearing 700 days, I've learnt a lot more than just the content of my flashcards, so here's a few of my favourites.

# Managing Dopamine Throughout the Day
Trying to perfect my focus and retention while doing flashcards led me down a huge rabbit hole of learning about dopamine, optimal study habits,
and anything I could get my hands on to study better. One of the most influential and valuable things I changed in my study schedule was doing
flashcard reviews first thing every morning. By studying first thing in the morning, my brain hasn't yet been exposed to activities that would give it dopamine
such as YouTube, games, random research topics, or whatever it may be. By rolling out of bed, brushing my teeth, and immediately starting reviewing flashcards,
it's all I've been exposed to for the morning, which keeps me far more focused than trying to do it during random times throughout the day.

This also led to trying to min-max how I use my phones to reduce distractions meaning I have an almost dedicated second study phone at this point. 
More on this in my [phone setup](/posts/phone-setup) post.

# SRS, FSRS, and Optimising Settings
Complete optimisation of your Anki settings is very complex and perfecting your FSRS parameters by manually removing or adjusting them is still beyond me. Something simple that I recommend everyone enable immediately is FSRS. [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS) is a spaced repetition algorithm that is better than the legacy SM-2 algorithm for [99% of users](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark/blob/main/plots/Superiority%2C%2019990.png) \(based on FSRS-5, not the latest FSRS6). This does introduce a few more settings so it's probably worthwhile to learn a little about what's going on. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/18jvyun/some_posts_and_articles_about_fsrs/) is a good place to find resources.

After that getting the learning and relearning steps right is important but is very personal. Sticking with the default settings is fine and if you feel its lacking in some way adjust as you see fit. 

Currently, my mining deck has learning steps of 5m and 14m with a relearning step of 11m. However, on my grammar deck I have learning steps of 20s, 1m and 5m, and relearning steps of 2m and 5m since I find I have more trouble remembering the grammar points.

Finally, ensuring maximum reviews a day is at 9999 is necessary to make sure you don't miss any reviews you should be doing that day.

# Anki makes me really sleepy
This one I don't understand too much, but doing Anki reviews often makes me sleepy, like really sleepy. I usually give it my best to do Anki on public
transport heading to uni but this almost always results in me staring at my phone blankly and falling asleep.

With the exception of times when I'm really pumped to do flashcards or I have an exam the next day, I do find it quite difficult to really get a large 
amount of reviews done. I definitely feel a bit jealous when I see posts about people who have no issues doing flashcards for 1-2 hours everyday
but I just have to direct my energy elsewhere.

# It's Okay to Reduce the Daily New Cards
When I first started using Anki, I decided on new words everyday no matter what. This was amazing at first, but when I started to come into more busy times during uni and especially during exams everything piled up. I was averaging 300+ reviews everyday \(Now I average 170\)
and it was taking time away from university study that I needed to be doing. This resulted in me quitting the app for a bit and coming back to a backlog of soo many reviews I didn't touch the app for a few months.

After starting again with Anki on a fresh deck and no backlog I eased my way in and was a bit more lenient. I still started with 15 new words a day
as I had lots of vocab I already knew to get through but as I found myself having more difficulty balancing flashcards and actual uni work I backed this down to 10
then 5, and stopped new cards during exams.

Taking a more relaxed approach and being a little more lenient with how many new cards I did a day made a huge difference to my motivation and ability to keep up
each day, now I do 5 new words a day on busier days bumping it up to 10 or 15 when I've got a little more time to study. I'm still fairly strict on finishing
my reviews each day \(apart from during exam block\) but removing the extra load for today and the next day has made a huge difference and I strongly recommend anyone
else doing flashcards everyday be a little more lenient with themselves sometimes.

# Creating Cards on Different Platforms
Finding cool ways to create cards has been one of my favourite things to do. Luckily since I am learning Japanese I'm seriously spoilt for choice when it comes to different tools people have created. I recently started trying out Migaku, which attempts to be an all in one app at the downside of costing money. While it works pretty well there are still plenty of things that I don't particularly like, which I might write about at some point.

The general workflow is to try and do things on the web and use [Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/) as a popup dictionary to quickly view definitions and forward data through [Anki-Connect](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect) to create a flashcard.

Some of my favourites tools for creating flashcards are:
- [Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/) for popup dictionaries
- [asbplayer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hkledmpjpaehamkiehglnbelcpdflcab?utm_source=item-share-cb) for use on video content
- [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro) to OCR images
- [ttu-ttu\'s ebook-reader](https://github.com/ttu-ttu/ebook-reader) for text files or documents.
- [Migaku](https://migaku.com/) all in one

And a couple good places to find guides to set them up are:
- [Donkuri's Immersion-Based Japanese Learning](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/) more detailed
- [JP Lazy Guide](https://lazyguidejp.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/) Bit more spoonfed
